Intro
-----
openBMS is a lithium ion battery management system(BMS) based on the [Linear Tech LTC6802-2](http://www.linear.com/product/LTC6802-2) integrated IC and [Cinch ModICE](http://www.cinch.com/products/transportation/modular-integrated-connector-enclosure) automotive enclosure. 

This BMS was originally designed by Ricky Gu of [UBC Electric Car Club](http://ubcecc.com) for the eBeetle project in spring 2010. The eBeetle became the [first electric vehicle to drive coast to coast across Canada](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/09/electrified-beetle-goes-coast-to-coast-in-canada/) in summer 2010. This BMS was one of the key component that enabled the eBeetle to drive 6400km in 14 days.
