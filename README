openBMS is a lithium ion battery management system(BMS) originally designed by Ricky Gu of UBC Electric Car Club for the eBeetle project. 

The eBeetle was the first electric vehicle to drive coast to coast across Canada in the summer of 2010. This BMS was one of the key component that enabled the eBeetle to drive 6400km in 14 days.
